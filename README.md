## Getting Ready to Get Ready

So! You're interested in playing an adventure game! There's only a few things you _need_ to do to
play:

1. Read the [Safety Tools](#safety-tools) section and send Mikey any questions, concerns, and
   especially any lines/veils you want added.
1. Read [How Mikey Runs Games](#how-mikey-runs-games) so you know what to expect in play.
1. Read about [Fari App](#fari-app), the tool we'll be using to play.
1. Read the [Getting Ready](#getting-ready) section. You don't _have_ to follow the instructions
   there before we play, but it will certainly make things go faster!

If you have any questions or just want to talk, you can always reach out to Mikey and he'll be happy
to help. You can also [file an issue][gh-issue] or [start a discussion][gh-discussion], he's
watching the repo.

### Safety Tools

We've all got different backgrounds and experiences. To make sure we're all able to have fun
together without making anyone uncomfortable, there's a few tools we're going to have available and
use if needed.

It's always better to have the tools and not need them than to run into a situation where things
fall apart and we wish we'd had them. Mikey will default to preferring the psychological and
emotional safety of the players over everything else. The point is to have fun and that's hard to do
when we're upset, uncomfortable, or hurt.

Safety tools are not a replacement for respect or talking to each other. They're _just tools_ to
help us shape our conversations and play and handle things when something goes wrong.

#### Lines & Veils

Lines and veils are used to set boundaries on content in a game.

**Lines** are hard limits on content, things that you don't want to engage in. Setting up a line
means that content won't show up in the game at all.

**Veils** are soft limits, things that are ok "behind a curtain" or when they "cut-to-black."
Setting up a veil means that the content might be in the game but not spotlighted or described in
great detail. Lines and veils can be adjusted as needed throughout the game.

#### Traffic Lights

Traffic lights are check-in tools in the form of **Stop** (Red), **Slow Down** (Yellow), and **Keep
Going** (Green):

- **Stop**: Use this at any point if you feel uncomfortable with the conversation or game. When you
  do, we can change, rewind, or skip content. We can break for the session if needed. Mikey will
  check in with you privately to see what you need and how he can help. If you think you want or
  need to use this, **_please_** do. A game where someone is stuck feeling uncomfortable, upset, or
  hurt is not a fun game. The people we're playing with come first.
- **Slow Down**: Use this if you feel like things are headed towards needing to call a **Stop**.
  This helps us get ahead of problems before anyone gets hurt or upset. It's also a very useful way
  to help remind ourselves when we're approaching a Line or Veil.
- **Keep Going**: Use this if you're feeling enthusiastic about where things are heading. Mikey may
  occasionally prompt the group in chat or voice, asking "Green light?" to make sure everyone's
  having fun and feeling safe enough to keep playing.

There's a few ways we can invoke traffic lights in play:

1. Speak up. Say "stop" or "red light" when you need us to stop. Say "slow down" or "yellow light"
   when you need us to slow down. Say "keep going" or "green light" when you want us to keep going.
1. Comment in chat. Type "stop" or "red light" or use the ðŸ›‘ or ðŸŸ¥ emoji when you need us to stop.
   Type "slow down" or "yellow light" or use the âš  or ðŸŸ¨ emoji when you need us to slow down. Say
   "keep going" or "green light" or use the âœ… or ðŸŸ© emoji when you want us to keep going.
1. Message Mikey. You can always send Mikey a private message when you need us to stop or slow down
   and he will handle it for the group, keeping you anonymous if you're not comfortable speaking up
   or commenting in chat.

### How Mikey Runs Games

When Mikey runs games, he has a few principles and procedures he uses.

#### Principles

1. You don't _need_ to know anything about the game, the setting, or anything about RPGs in general
   to play. You will never be punished for not knowing things.
1. Mikey's job is to facilitate the game and make sure everyone is enjoying themselves and gets to
   be as engaged as they want to be. No one is required or expected to be a professional actor
   anything.
1. All you need to do when we're playing is make decisions about what your character is doing.
   Everything else Mikey will handle or help you with.

#### Procedures

In general, the flow of play is:

1. Mikey describes something to the group, providing context
1. Someone asks a question or states an intent
1. Mikey talks to everyone until the question is answered or the context changes

Most of the game can (and probably will!) move along without a whole lot of needing to consult
rules. Mikey uses an adjudication flow that goes like this:

1. A player states their **intent**--what they want to change or make true in the fiction.
1. A player states (or Mikey prompts them for) their **approach**--how their character tries to
   fulfill the intent.
1. Mikey asks himself these questions:
   1. Can the combined intent and approach succeed?
   1. Can it fail?
   1. Does failure have meaningful consequences?
1. If any of the answers to those questions are a "no" Mikey will talk through the outcome with the
   player, but they don't need to roll any dice. If the answers to all three questions are "yes"
   Mikey will call for a test, help the player figure out how to do that, and explain what happens
   in the fiction.

Playing tabletop games is mostly just talking and imagining together. We only need the rules when
we're not sure if something should happen or not.

### Fari App

[Fari App][fari-home] is a free open source tool developed and maintained by an indie designer,
[RenÃ©-Pier][rp-twitter]. We'll be using it to keep our characters and roll dice while we play.

To check things out and get a little familiar with the interface:

1. [Download this sample character][phiqil-json]
1. Open the [Fari App][fari-home] in your browser
1. Select "My Binder" in the top left
1. Select "Characters"
1. Select "Import"
1. Choose the file you downloaded in the first step and select "Open"
1. Select the newly imported character

![Gif of the Fari App UI showing how to import and view a character sheet][gif-import]

Once you've imported and selected the character, you'll be on a page that has the character sheet
open. You can freely edit and poke around here.

The most important things to note are:

- You can left-click any dice icon you see to roll the appropriate dice. When you do, a box on the
  bottom-left of the screen will update, turning blue with a `~`. Hover on the box to see your
  rolled result.

  ![Gif of the Fari App UI showing how to roll the dice and see the result][gif-roll]
- On the bar at the bottom of the screen is a blue button labeled "Roll" with a die icon. Click the
  icon to bring up a modal menu to choose dice you want to roll. Left click on an icon to add that
  die, right-click to remove. Select the "Roll" portion of the button to roll your selected dice.

  ![Gif of the Fari App UI showing how to select custom dice, roll, and see the result][gif-custom]
- In many sections, there's one or more circles with a number in each one (usually 0). Select the
  number to edit it directly. Hover on the circle to see the `-` and `+` icons. Select the `-` icon
  to decrement the value by 1. Select the `+` icon to increment the value by 1.

  ![Gif of the Fari App UI showing how to edit, decrement, and increment numbers][gif-circles]
- Click on the "Character," "Domains," and "Tricks" tabs to explore the character and see the
  references. You don't need to understand anything in detail, but if the help text is unclear
  please let Mikey know - these characters are filled out via a public template and he'll happily
  improve it.

## Getting Ready

To prepare for the game, pick the option that sounds most correct for you, then
follow the instructions.

- I just wanna play, please don't make me do homework ðŸ˜£
  1. Read the [Cast of Characters](#a-cast-of-characters) and pick the one you like best.
  1. Let Mikey know which character you picked so he can make a note and assign things for you.
- I'd like to look into things a bit, but I might need help ðŸ˜Š
  1. Read about the [Playkit](#the-playkit-picaroons).
  1. Decide whether to make your own character or choose a [ready-made one](#a-cast-of-characters).
     - If you're going with a ready-made character, you can either use them as-is or you can modify them; feel free to change anything on the sheet to suit your needs!
     - If you're going with making your own character, see [Making a Character](#making-a-character) for how you can do that in Fari.
- This is old hat, wizard, nothing in your tomes will challenge me âœ¨
  1. You don't need instructions, you've got this. ðŸ’œ
  1. But if you'd _really_ like to help, you can make a couple characters and submit them to this
     repository as extra ready-made characters for everyone to see/choose from!

## The Playkit: Picaroons

The rules we're using for this game come from [Picaroons][picaroons-home]. It's a small text without
much to say, but reading the rules may help you understand how things work and will certainly help
you make your own character if that's what you want.

## A Cast of Characters

- [Phiqil the Precocious][phiqil-json]: Lots of learning, not very tough. Has access to book magic,
  water magic, math magic, and earth magic.

> **Note**
> Mikey will be adding more pre-generated characters soon and will keep everyone updated as he does!

## Making a Character

To make a new character, open the [Fari App][fari-home]. Select "My Binder," in the top-left. In the
modal, select "Characters" and then "New."

When the new character page opens, select the "Template" dropdown, type "Picaroon" and hit enter or
select the dropdown item. When the page prompts you to confirm loading the template, select "OK."

Left-click on the die icon in the "Hit Dice" section. Verify the result by hovering over the blue
box with the tilde (`~`) symbol in the bottom left of the page. The rolled value is your starting
hit points (HP).

Select the circle with a 0 in it below the "Hit Points" header in the "Hit Dice" section. Enter the
rolled value from the previous step.

Calculate how many domains you start with by subtracting your HP from 6. For example, if you start
with 4 HP, you have 2 domains. If you start with 1 HP, you have 5 domains.

### Domains

Navigate to the "Domains" tab. Select the "Advanced Mode" toggle in the top-left to enable editing
this tab.

If you have no idea what to choose for your first domain,
[get a random number from 1 to 200][random-200] and consult [this table][table-failed-careers]. Use
the occupation as your domain and note the starting weapon and something extra (you'll add them to
your equipment later when [finishing your character](#finishing-your-character)).

For more ideas, you can use [this random skill generator][random-skill-perchance] or explore
[the pages on Seventh Sanctum][seventh-sanctum] to randomly generate inspiration.

To add more domains:

1. Hover over the file icon in the top right of the existing domain section (the black bar) until
   the hover text reads "Copy Section's Blocks." Select the icon.
1. Select "Add Section" to the right. Select the clipboard icon under the new section between the
   "Add Block" and "Add Section" buttons.
1. Fill out the domain as normal.
1. To add more domains, either:
   - Locate the `+` symbol on the right-hand edge of the second column and select it, then start
     over from step 2. How many columns you can add depends on your screen width.
   - Scroll down until you see the `Add Section` button beneath one of your existing domains and
     select it, then start over from step 2.

### Tricks

Navigate to the "Tricks" tab. Ensure the "Advanced Mode" toggle in the top-left is on to enable
editing this tab.

You can pick [any trick from the book][picaroons-tricks] that seems even tangentially related to
your domain. Mikey won't argue with you. If you'd rather come up with something yourself or ask
Mikey for help, definitely ping him and he'll be happy to chat. For inspiration, you can explore
[Seventh Sanctum][seventh-sanctum]; in particular, the anime powers, combat moves, and magic
sections make for good trick ideas. Use the tricks from the book as a guideline on the mechanisms or
ask Mikey for help.

To add more tricks:

1. Hover over the file icon in the top right of the existing trick section (the black bar) until
   the hover text reads "Copy Section's Blocks." Select the icon.
1. Select "Add Section" to the right. Select the clipboard icon under the new section between the
   "Add Block" and "Add Section" buttons.
1. Fill out the trick as normal.
1. To add more tricks, either:
   - Locate the `+` symbol on the right-hand edge of the second column and select it, then start
     over from step 2. How many columns you can add depends on your screen width.
   - Scroll down until you see the `Add Section` button beneath one of your existing domains and
     select it, then start over from step 2.

When you have filled out your tricks, navigate to the "Character" tab.

### Taking on Debt

If you want to add more domains, you will need to take on debt.

Click the dice icon labeled "Debt" in the "Quick Reference" section. Verify the result by hovering
over the blue box with the tilde (`~`) symbol in the bottom left of the page. The lower value is the
number of new domains you can add. The higher number tells you how many dice to roll to determine
your actual debt.

Select the blue circle icon in the bottom left. When the modal pops up, click the six-sided die icon
until the small number icon over it matches the higher result from your debt roll. Ensure the "Pool"
toggle at the bottom of the modal is set to off. Click the "Roll" button in the bottom left and
verify the result.

Locate the circle labeled "Silver Owed to (Creditor)" and select it. Enter the result value followed
by two zeroes. For example, if you roll a 13, enter `1300`. Invent a name and general idea for your
creditor or message Mikey to work with you on an idea for who loaned you money.

If you want, you can take on more debt. For this game, stop taking on debt if it goes over 3000.

Don't forget to add your new domains and tricks, you paid for them!

### Finishing your Character

Navigate to the "Character" tab. Name your character and specify their pronouns in parentheses. Set
your group to "Azure Frogs."

Locate the "Things Carried" text entry in the "Possessions" section. You can list whatever you want
here or use a generator:

- [OD&D][random-equipment-odnd]: Ignore the money. You're broke.
- [Maze Rats][random-equipment-mr]: Click as many times as you want.
- [Reddit][random-equipment-reddit]: Roll as directed.
